Explorer User Stories
=====================

.. story:: Project & Event Explorer
   :id: US_EXP_SIDEBAR
   :status: implemented
   :priority: mandatory
   :links: US_MSG_CHATQUEUE

   **As a** Jarvis User,
   **I want** a dedicated sidebar in VS Code that lists my projects, events, and messages in three separate groups,
   **so that** I can quickly see and navigate to my active projects and upcoming events without leaving the editor.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: A "Jarvis" icon appears in the VS Code Activity Bar
   * AC-2: Clicking the icon opens a sidebar panel
   * AC-3: The sidebar contains three collapsible sections: "Projects", "Events",
     and "Messages"
   * AC-4: Each section displays items hierarchically — subfolders appear as collapsible
     folder nodes, YAML files within them as leaf items. The full folder tree is shown recursively.


.. story:: Project Folder Filter
   :id: US_EXP_PROJECTFILTER
   :status: implemented
   :priority: optional

   **As a** Jarvis User,
   **I want** to show/hide individual folders in the Projects explorer,
   **so that** I can hide archived or irrelevant project folders and focus on active work.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: A filter icon in the Projects title bar opens a QuickPick listing all project folders
   * AC-2: Folders can be toggled visible/hidden via multi-select
   * AC-3: The filter selection persists across VS Code restarts (workspaceState)
   * AC-4: When a filter is active, the icon visually indicates that filtering is applied


.. story:: Future Event Filter
   :id: US_EXP_EVENTFILTER
   :status: implemented
   :priority: optional

   **As a** Jarvis User,
   **I want** to toggle a filter in the Events explorer that shows only upcoming events,
   **so that** I can focus on what's ahead without past events cluttering the view.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: A filter icon in the Events title bar toggles the future-only filter on/off with a single click
   * AC-2: When active, only events whose end date (``dates.end``) is on or after today are shown
   * AC-3: Events without a parseable end date are shown regardless of filter state (fail-open)
   * AC-4: When the filter is active, the icon visually indicates the active state
   * AC-5: The filter state persists across VS Code restarts (workspaceState)


.. story:: Open YAML from Tree Item
   :id: US_EXP_OPENYAML
   :status: implemented
   :priority: optional

   **As a** Jarvis User,
   **I want** to open the YAML file of a project or event directly from the tree view,
   **so that** I can quickly view or edit the raw data in the VS Code editor.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Each project leaf item shows an inline action button (go-to-file icon) on hover
   * AC-2: Each event leaf item shows an inline action button (go-to-file icon) on hover
   * AC-3: Clicking the button opens the associated YAML file in the VS Code editor
   * AC-4: Clicking on the tree item label itself does nothing (``TreeItem.command`` stays
     empty, reserved for a future detail view)
   * AC-5: Folder nodes do not have this button
