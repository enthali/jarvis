## Summary

Cosmetic fix, pre-release polish for the "Consequent Actor Renaming" release. The inline icon order on category nodes in the unified "Jarvis Entities" tree is inconsistent between Projects (Filter, then New) and Events (New, then Filter). Align both category nodes to use the same icon order (Filter, then New — matching Projects' current order) via the `group`/order values in `packages/pim/package.json`'s `view/item/context` contributions. No functional change, purely a menu-ordering fix.

### Artefakt-Removal-Check

*Fill in only when this CR removes an artefact (file, field, configuration key, REQ-ID).*

For each removed artefact, run a project-wide grep on all plausible name variants and classify results:

| Removed Artefact | Class (a): Code/Workflow refs | Class (b): Doc refs | Class (c): Historic Change Docs |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `{artefact name}` | {files + lines fixed / none} | {files + lines fixed / none} | {count — acceptable historic stranding} |

- [ ] All class (a) active code/workflow references fixed in this CR
- [ ] All class (b) active documentation references fixed in this CR
- [ ] Class (c) historical Change Documents accepted as "acceptable historic stranding" and disclosed above

### Issues Found

- [ ] Issue 1: ...
- [ ] Issue 2: ...

### Sign-off

- [ ] All levels completed (no ⚠️ DEPRECATED markers remaining)
- [ ] All conflicts resolved
- [ ] Traceability verified
- [ ] Ready for implementation

## QM Findings

*QM writes findings directly into this section after each review round. PM records
decisions (fix-now / defer / accept-as-is) with rationale in the same section.
Multiple review rounds are appended as sub-sections. Existing CDs without this
section are unaffected — the section is additive, never required retroactively.*

### Round 1

**Reviewed by:** QM
**Review date:** 2026-07-14
**Scope:** Proportionate (manifest-only cosmetic change)

#### Verification Summary

**CLEAR** — Zero findings. Change is exactly as described.

**Diff verified** (pim/package.json `view/item/context` section):
- `jarvis.filterProjectFolders`/`Active` → `"group": "inline@1"` ✓
- `jarvis.newProject` → `"group": "inline@2"` ✓
- `jarvis.filterFutureEvents`/`Active` → `"group": "inline@1"` ✓
- `jarvis.newEvent` → `"group": "inline@2"` ✓

Filter → New order is now consistent across both Projects and Events category nodes. No functional changes, no spec amendments, no TypeScript affected.

#### Findings

| # | Level | Element ID | Finding | Severity |
|---|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| — | — | — | *No findings* | — |

#### PM Decisions

| # | Finding # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------|
| — | — | — | *No decisions required (CLEAR verdict)* |
