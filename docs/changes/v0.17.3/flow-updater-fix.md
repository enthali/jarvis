## Summary

GH Issue #30: the self-update "Download & Install" flow's extension-ID →
VSIX-filename mapping in `packages/core/src/engine/core/updateCheck.ts` is
missing an entry for `enthali.jarvis-flow`. When a user with jarvis-flow
installed clicks "Download & Install" on an update notification,
jarvis-core/pim/mcp/recorder get updated but jarvis-flow is silently
skipped — no error is shown because the other extensions do match, so the
"no matching assets" fallback path never triggers. User discovered this via
a real update attempt. `SPEC_REL_UPDATENOTIFY`'s VSIX filename mapping table
is equally out of date (missing the `jarvis-flow` row) — jarvis-flow was
added to the suite after this spec was last touched. Fix: add the missing
mapping entry (verify actual VSIX filename convention against `packages/flow`'s
build output) and update the corresponding spec table.

### Artefakt-Removal-Check

*Fill in only when this CR removes an artefact (file, field, configuration key, REQ-ID).*

For each removed artefact, run a project-wide grep on all plausible name variants and classify results:

| Removed Artefact | Class (a): Code/Workflow refs | Class (b): Doc refs | Class (c): Historic Change Docs |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `{artefact name}` | {files + lines fixed / none} | {files + lines fixed / none} | {count — acceptable historic stranding} |

- [ ] All class (a) active code/workflow references fixed in this CR
- [ ] All class (b) active documentation references fixed in this CR
- [ ] Class (c) historical Change Documents accepted as "acceptable historic stranding" and disclosed above

### Issues Found

- [ ] Issue 1: ...
- [ ] Issue 2: ...

### Sign-off

- [ ] All levels completed (no ⚠️ DEPRECATED markers remaining)
- [ ] All conflicts resolved
- [ ] Traceability verified
- [ ] Ready for implementation

## QM Findings

*QM writes findings directly into this section after each review round. PM records
decisions (fix-now / defer / accept-as-is) with rationale in the same section.
Multiple review rounds are appended as sub-sections. Existing CDs without this
section are unaffected — the section is additive, never required retroactively.*

### Round 1

**Reviewed by:** QM
**Review date:** 2026-07-15
**Scope:** Proportionate (2-line data addition, no spec structure change)

#### Verification Summary

**CLEAR** — Zero findings. Both additions correct and consistent.

- `updateCheck.ts`: `'enthali.jarvis-flow': \`jarvis-flow-${newVersion}.vsix\`` — publisher `enthali` and name `jarvis-flow` match `packages/flow/package.json` exactly ✓
- `spec_rel.rst` SPEC_REL_UPDATENOTIFY table: `enthali.jarvis-flow` / `jarvis-flow-{version}.vsix` row consistent with code ✓

#### Findings

| # | Level | Element ID | Finding | Severity |
|---|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| — | — | — | *No findings* | — |

#### PM Decisions

| # | Finding # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------|
| — | — | — | *No decisions required (CLEAR verdict)* |
